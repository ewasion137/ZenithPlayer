# ZenithPlayer (UMPlayer (Just a bit rename, dont mind it))
**Zenith Player - A player, with great visuals, made listen tracks &amp; edit them.**

1. You can edit music: Slow Down / Speed Up ; Equalization
2. Visuals are beautifull (see down).
3. FL Studio like stop: After you stop the track, it reverts to where your marker were set
4. Automatic folder, sub-folder scanning.
5. Equalization, speed settings are saved for every track **individually**

I would be happy if you use it and review, or give an issue for a bug.

It were made by help of AI (mostly in spectogram and other)

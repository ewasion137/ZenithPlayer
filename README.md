# ZenithPlayer
**Zenith Player - A player, with great visuals, made listen tracks &amp; edit them.**

Pros:
1. You can edit music: Slow Down / Speed Up ; Equalization
2. Optimizaton: If program eats too much of GPU - Press `GFX: ON` to turn it off to `GFX: OFF`
3. Visuals are beautifull (see down).
4. FL Studio like stop: After you stop the track, it reverts to where your marker were set
5. Automatic folder, sub-folder scanning.
6. Equalization, speed settings are saved for every track **individually**

Cons:
1. Sometimes program can eat TOO much GPU (fixed by `GFX: OFF`)
2. It's in beta test.

I would be happy if you use it and review, or give an issue for a bug.
